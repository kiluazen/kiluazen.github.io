<p>Hello, I am Kushal, an Aerospace Engineering Student.
Between the computer, phone, and guitar, my whole day passes. People say I don’t talk much, but I can talk if we have some time and one-on-one. It’s harder in the first interactions.</p>

<p>I was born in Chikmagaluru(in Karnataka) 20 years ago, and my family moved to Guntur(in AP) when I was 6 years old.</p>

<p>I was good at studying and scoring grades, which continued until my JEE exams, and once I got my laptop and phone for college, everything changed. I started watching many movies, tv shows and reading books.</p>

<p>All these different perspectives I had never thought about just popped up, and I started recognizing and correcting the stupid ways I used to think.</p>

<p>Amongst the books I have read, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are just so inspiring and mind-blowing that someone could write that. The topics she talked about in those books, like reasoning and selfishness, were some things I was wired to be against, and just learning her viewpoints had so much influence on me.</p>

<p>I watched many movies in the first two years of college, maybe too many.
I like it when movies mess you up a bit when they make you contemplate your current state. Movies like good will hunting, dead poets society, and tv shows like sex education and Normal people are some, that gave me epiphanies that I wish had occurred to me earlier in my life.</p>

<p>I listen to music a lot and thought it would be cooler if I could play some. So I started learning guitar. As I used to watch many movies, everything I did seemed harder because movies make it look so easy. I thought I would be a Rockstar in a month when I started playing guitar. As it got harder, I gave up, but now I have started learning guitar again as I realized it’s not so much the destination as the journey, and the harder it is, the more rewarding, so if you like it, keep doing it.</p>

<p>I took Aerospace Engineering because I wanted to build rockets,
It’s funny because when you start studying rockets, you would think that you would feel your ability to build them will increase, but it’s actually been the opposite. It seems so complicated and not possible now that I know the nitty-gritty of things. It may seem daunting, but I still want to pursue my goal.</p>

<p>The best things I do in my day are brushing my teeth at night while standing in front of a mirror, thinking about what I have done that day and what I want to do tomorrow. The other best thing is walking to classes while listening to podcasts.</p>

<p>I have been listening to Lex Fridman and Joe Rogan podcasts a lot. They are great.
In Podcasts, you get to be in a conversation with people you admire, Podcasts are long, and they leave you with content.</p>

<p>I got into an argument with my mother once. She was telling me to prepare for the placements. I got exasperated, partly because I couldn’t explain to her the way I was thinking about it, that placements are too short-term of a goal and blah blah blah, then I felt guilty that I got angry at her, from her perspective it totally made sense, by the way, my mother and I have a minimal relationship, we rarely open up, and when she did I got angry, and I felt so guilty about that, that’s when I decided,</p>

<p>I want to be stoic in my arguments and serene in my actions.</p>
