<meta name="description" content="Exam Fucking hell man, I didn’t answer a single question in todays exam man. Not kidding literally nothing.(Vibrations Course) It was a 90 mins exam, I read the questions they were all really interesting I kind of feel bad that I couldn’t solve such beautiful questions. On a side note if you don’t do well in the endsem for this course you have a strong chance of failing because I saw people writing well in the class, but anyway you will learn a lot preparing for the exam (this is a good course) So don’t screw up and fail because failing is going back and we don’t wanna do that. Halloween They was a fashion GC by style up, Hostels competed dressing scary and stuff typical fashion show (with themes and formations) I didn’t stay for long though I was there for half an hour and I left , Sudden epiphany happened The dialogue that College is for fun, ‘people don’t realize that college is a vacation where you can study and party every weekend(I mean all these events)’ -Balaji Srinivas [ we can’t realize that because we haven’t worked before that ] , We have this information acquired till 21 and not used anywhere and as soon as you go to the job market none of these matter and by the time you are thirty you don’t know what Fourier series or Bessel functions are…….. So the advice I want to give myself is you should find a way to be economically stable even you are a student [find a way to earn money then your study here becomes magical], now all I think about is getting a job intern and stuff and I even forgot what Fourier series was today which such a shame as an engineer. Also whenever I attend these events I always feel like I could have participated in the event and after the event I get pumped up to participate in one of these next time and it never happened, Clearly it feels fishy its like you don’t even have a girlfriend and you talk about the girls you can’t fuck if you are in a relationship, Just be happy that you are invited to the party (in this case events) and have a good time as soon as the day is over these will be just memories. Anyway man find a way to make money or you will waste the one and half year left on this campus. You really like studying Rocket engines and stuff man (you are a nerd) don’t forget that because I seen you study and you feel fucking nirvana when you study these things. But I know that the knowledge in these things is very low for me ( and I actually over estimate my intellect in these things) anyway fake it till you make it - am I right boys?" />
