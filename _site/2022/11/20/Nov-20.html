    <p>Well well well…… I had my Aerodynamics Exam today AE333 which was really great, the exam that I was most prepared of, so what can I say, I actually didn’t have time to answer all the questions, I always used to have time to contemplate on questions because there weren’t much that I could answer, but here I felt like I could answer all the questions.</p>

<p>Then Later I came back and started reading the Midnight Libraries, and slept reading it for a while.</p>

<p>I don’t know after the reviewer gave a slightly less review for this book, the enthusiasm flew away a little bit, I shouldn’t really totally depend on his review, I got to have my own opinions.</p>

<p>Well it’s a great book I am gonna read it and see for myself how it is..</p>

<p>This weird feeling that I am gonna post a status of this book as soon as I finish it, I hate that whenever it creeps in, just read it if you like it and you can think about posting it later.</p>

<p>Also I went to the gym early today and I was talking to Taha while I was there on my phone and roaming around and I saw a girl (blue died hair), sitting there alone and playing with carrom coins, so I went up there and said “ Are you waiting for someone or can I join “, she immediately said yes and directed me the chair, and I introduced myself her name was Verniti ( I think I am not sure already in just 4 hours).</p>

<p>Well we played a best of three and she won, but talked a lot, about her PHD in game theory and also about Taylor Swift and about various other things.</p>

<p>I guess we strongly connected on the Taylor swift things and I didn’t stutter anywhere in my talk( mostly English a little bit of Hindi too) she was from UP(near Lucknow).</p>

<p>Over all I think she was also a easy person to talk tooo and the conversation had a background of carroms so, It made the pauses seem ok.</p>

<p>Well this is great I should do this often.</p>

<p>My first female stranger talk in IITB ain’t that something.</p>
