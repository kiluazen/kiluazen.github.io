# Writers and Lovers

Jack Edwards, a YouTuber, posted a video, ‘20 books you should read in your 20s,’ and I recently turned 20. So here we are.

The book follows Casey, a woman in her 30s working as a waitress who has been writing a novel for six years. She graduated as a literary student with a huge amount of student debt. 

It’s witty, heart-breaking, get’s dark at times, and takes you through her hardships.

The book felt so relatable, Well, I am 20, and she is 32. Maybe not so much in terms of age, but I have some huge dreams, like becoming an entrepreneur and making cool stuff, playing the big-picture game, etc. Sometimes I contemplate if things don’t end up the way I dream, and this book made me feel at peace with that. Whatever I may have or don’t, I will have books and this BLOG.

### Texts I highlighted from the book

Kind of like this blog. I don’t think I have something to say that’s already been said. It’s more of a life documentation. It squares up my week, like was it good or bad than the previous week. Life is an infinite game. The only way to win is not to be better than others but to improve upon our previous selves.

Well, I observed this about me a couple of years ago, and now whenever I feel like people are looking or talking about me, I say not everything is about you, man.

It was reassuring cause sometimes I feel that way. It’s good to know women feel that way too.

Yeah, I don’t want to go on and on about my problems with everyone around me. Recently I think I have been doing it on Taha. I should really stop. Pity is the last thing I want. Well, now I have this blog, so I can do it here, ha ha ha haa…

I don’t know if this is how I feel, but I do remember moments when my parents were like we didn’t have all this, so utilize it and become what we couldn’t. One should be very careful in taking parents’ advice. I think people give way more value to their advice than they usually should, you have to remember they have their understanding from a different time, and I am not saying exclude it completely but be cautious they are not much smarter than you are. For that matter, no one is.

Watch this. Steve Jobs said it in a better way.

I got to remember this when I write, ‘Emotions are physical’.

This is where she is dating two men at the same time, which happens very naturally, and then she can’t decide which one to go for. It was really fun to read.

Context: She was a prodigy in golf.

When I read this, I felt goosebumps because, yeah, this was something I had been thinking about for a long time, I was very good at my high school studies, and now when I think about it, that felt a bit natural now learning anything feels a struggle to me( a constant struggle against distractions) I keep going to YouTube, movies and stuff like that.

When I read this, it almost felt like someone just roasted me. Because I was thinking for a while like this, I have huge ambitions like building a Rocket Company and Building all these great start-ups. Aah, this really helped me set my mind straight. Unless you work, what will you get? no one is destined for greatness. That’s ridiculous to think that way( well, I was thinking like that).

When I asked Taha to read this (I was hoping he would have an epiphany as I had), he said yeah, this argument is in every feminist literature he’s read, and I was like, WTF, and it took this long for me to discover this! Anyway, now this paragraph will always be a reminder whenever I think that way.

I was lured into thinking, that is so true, you are so smart you are good at school. Oh! You got into IIT; that’s marvelous. Now I am just lying around waiting for the years to pass. That is so fucked up. Now I kind of got a realization that I find joy and achievement in doing cognitive tasks, and I wanna learn to code, learn about Rocket Engines, and make cool things.

I just included this because this felt like a great conversation. When he replies, “ I wasn’t asking for that. Just Curious,” that feels heartwarming. I want to make great heartwarming conversations like that.

I have been procrastinating on the idea of writing about my thoughts on books I have read. After reading this, it became official, and here we are. This is the first book I am writing about, “Writers and Lovers.”

Context:   She gives a speech at a school for a Writing workshops day.

It felt comforting after reading this book, a feeling to say, ‘It’s gonna be All right.’

When things came full circle at the end, it was joyous.

### Takeaways

I wouldn’t be too nervous to ask out a girl I like.

You are not destined for greatness.
