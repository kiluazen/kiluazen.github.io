I booked a cab to Dadar Railway Station. So he left me after ceossing through a huge bridge just beside platform 7.

Where is my train indicated that the train would be at pf 7. So I thought I am here and stayed there quiet a while.

I had a dejavu that I don't recall this to be like this from my previous encounters.

Later I went to the swarch of people.

And with help of google found that. There is two parts of Dadar. Dadar Central and Dadar Western. And I was in dadar western pf7 , whilst I had to be at Dadar Central.

Finally I went there and there my train was .

Also about today.

Fucking ear pain is back again.ðŸ™Œalso I went to get a hair cut but there was no one there .And Me and Hrishikesh are working out together.

We do Abs together. Its soo goood.

I feel my stomach muscles dude.

We done it twice, I hope we continue after coming back tooo.

Anyway I will do the 10 min ab workout even when I am home.

I hope I will be as productive as I ever been and more.

I completed Midnight Libraries, made me cry a little. When she comes back to her life and his brother comes to see her. It was great dialogue there, I ennacted it and cried such a great experience.

Also I wil hug my mother when I am home, I never done that before, no idea why. If you don't express no one will ever know.
