Last Night I slept at 2 am, after watching a movie called “Rushmore” by Wes Anderson, it was good, but it made a bit morose, because I am in no clubs at all, none. Well what can I say, I am very much like the idea of it but never got into it, always watched movies and stuff like that and passed time.

Now it’s 11:45 am, I slept for 9 and 1/2 hours, that’s crazy dude, I had a class at 9:30 which I didn’t attend, Kushal you got to put some breaks here what is wrong with you man, you are just being crazy right now. Dude attend the classes, read for the classes, don’t be the old douchebag like your Second year again.

You are not gonna people or talk to them if you sit in your house binging movies and tvshows alright. So enough in three days you have watched 5 movies and two episodes of a tv show(the last of us) it should stop right now, that’s enough.

So by the way yesterday I though watching “Dead Poets Society” again, to get some inspiration, and I watched for half an hour and decided I got to start the poets society again, so I went to Taha’s hostel, proposed the idea he accepted and we went to OAT (open air theatre) , I didn’t want rush into the poems, so we started talking about someone who had a breakup recently and then about my writing classes, later I started reading a book called “five centuries of Engilsh verse” the one they read in the movie, but it was bad it had very old poems. Luckily I had a book with a collection of poems written by Pablo Neruda in my kindle, We read them, they were about love and stuff like that, not really appealing to a bunch of virgins.

I will have to bring a new book with some existential poems next time, “sucking the marrow out of life”.

Anyway the realizations from this blog are, wake up at a specific time, do the class work quickly to have freedom and no regret, stop watching movies, I know they are not bad but there is a line and you have crossed it long ago.

Don’t forget this video, the title feels too much but there are some good points in there.

Remember, not getting distracted is a virtue these days, it wasn’t previously, now we need to constantly fight the algorithms to do our work.
