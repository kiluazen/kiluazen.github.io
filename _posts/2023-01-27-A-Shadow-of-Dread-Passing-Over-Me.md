I was walking from the library to my room feeling hungry, thinking of all the things I have done today and for a past couple of days, Today I made a decision not to drop the Machine learning course which I very much feel I am gonna regret, because I think part of the reason I didn’t drop it is I was lazy to go to the admin office, drop deadline was done weeks before.

I tell to myself you are gonna work hard brother, learn machine learning everything works on that in this day and age so it will be useful to learn that, I woke up at 9:15 and watched Mr. Beast podcast and seeing him explain youtube, I went to his youtube channel and watched couple of his videos and saw the things he was talking about like retention and pace of the content, it was 12:30 when I was done with that, later I showered had some lunch, I think I am over consuming food these days, (like I am feeling stomach full which is not a good feeling). Then attended the lab, later I had a class at 5:30 (Flight Mechanics) which I didn’t attend because he asks questions and I don’t have answers because I don’t know the concepts, never given time to learn them, it’s really embarrassing when he asks you can’t say you don’t know, everyone laughs, I feel very anxious going to that class out of very few times I attend. When I went to the library, I started watching youtube some silly youtube videos and then watched good will hunting again.

Later took a nap for 15 min and walking home, felt this shadow of dread all over me. 

What am I doing with my life? I have no idea.

I am not passionate about anything, If I am asked what I love to do, I have no answer to give. I just tell aerospace to my parents to escape the conversation with them.

What am I doing missing classes, watching senseless youtube videos for hours.

By the way I feel very connected to Good Will Hunting Movie, I mean I am not that genius, but I am good at math and stuff like that, don’t know what to do with my life.

I like the fact that he is 20 in the movie because I am 20 now too, don’t feel abandoned or anything.

Just you know it’s okay if you read books like writers and lovers or anything they help you in a way, but if you entertain with youtube videos you can’t get back to work in an hour just like that.

Fill you entertainment time with guitar, gym, journaling and stuff like that man, please.

Can you go a week without watching a youtube video. Oh my god I don’t think you can.

show it to me Kushal go without watching a single fucking youtube video for a week.
