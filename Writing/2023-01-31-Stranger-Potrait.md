I am in the Central Library, there are variety of tables here, I decided to sit on the bigger one which has four seats two on each side, at 10’o clock direction there is a girl who is seated facing a little towards me on a table which is made for one person, it has walls all around it, so that you don’t get distracted by other beings.

She is leaned back with her neck on the chair’s tip, head tilted forward, facing her phone, She is texting with her legs crossed, swinging her right leg.

Her face is like a model feature (lack of a better way to describe), by that I mean she seems energetic, sophisticated and mysterious, One would be drawn to talk to her.

She is wearing a cap which covers her ears and her forehead, her hair tips are colored gold which emerge as the cap ends, she has a light pink t-shirt on the contrast created with the golden hair on her shoulders and the light pink is so beautiful. 

Her grey-black colored cap has a white feather printed on her forehead.

Her right thumb is juggling on the phone, so quick and efficient like the needle in a sewing machine.  She smiles in between while texting, must be a witty conversation.

She has sweater tied around her hips, a classy look isn’t it?  A cap, hair tipped gold, sweater tied around hips.
